    <p>15 minutes later, THIS is the sight that will be in front of you. And you’ll make 60 million Italians beam with pride!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>8 oz bacon</li>
        <li>3.5 oz parmigiano reggiano</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>14 oz spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cooking/kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pasta cooking water</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, finely minced</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Bacon</strong> - Cut into 0.5cm / 1/5" thick slices then into batons.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Carbonara sauce</strong> - Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine. Then stir in the parmesan and pepper.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Cook pasta</strong> - Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with the salt. Add pasta and cook per the packet directions.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Reserve pasta water</strong> - Just before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Cook bacon</strong> - While the pasta is cooking, place bacon in a non stick pan over medium high heat.<br> Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden. No oil needed – as the bacon heats up, the fat will melt so it fries in its own fat. If using garlic, add it in the last minute.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Pasta in pan</strong> - Tip the hot pasta into the pan and toss to coat in bacon fat.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Mix pasta in sauce</strong> - Transfer the pasta and any residual fat in the pan into the bowl with the egg.<br> Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) pasta cooking water. Stir vigorously using the handle of a wooden spoon for 1 minute<br> and watch as the sauce transforms from watery to creamy and clings to the pasta strands!</li><br>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong> - Transfer into warm bowls. Serve immediately, garnished with a little extra<br> parmigiana reggiano if desired, and a pinch of black pepper and finely chopped parsley.</li><br>
    </ol>
